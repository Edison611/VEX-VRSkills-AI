# Goal
The goal of this project is to find the most efficient skills path to take for VRC 2024-2025 High Stakes. In the future, it can also be used to potentially simulate meta bots facing each other.

This is only for the VEX High Stakes Skills with many features not implemented yet. In its first iteration for simplicity, it contains only red discs and mobile goals. The rules of those features are included but the blue rings, non-mobile stakes, and hang are not yet implemented. Some interactions may be janky (especially the collisions), but will soon be fixed.
